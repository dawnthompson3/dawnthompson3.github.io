                        Hi, I’m Dawn! I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington in Seattle with a Bachelor of Arts in Geography (Geographic Information Systems) and Political Science and a minor in Informatics (Data Science).<br><br>You may be wondering how I ended up with this assortment of seemingly unrelated disciplines on my transcript. The answer is simple: I opted to diversify instead of specialize. There is always going to be someone who knows more about a subject than I do, but where I excel is in drawing connections.<br><br>So, where do Geography, Political Science, and Informatics intersect? Computational social science.<br><br>I am passionate about computational social science because it enables me to combine what I love and what I am skilled at to fulfill the needs of the world; it is an interdisciplinary field that does not confine my curiosity nor my innovation. I navigate the world through quantitative and qualitative data and process it into information so that others can acquire knowledge and wisdom, but I cannot complain because it has been quite an impressive journey so far.

			    <h3>Interracial Marriage and Rational Choice Theory</h3>
			    <p>
				    March 2019 - I wrote a Sociology research paper that used rational choice theory, game theory, and social exchange theory to explain the increase in interracial marriages in the United States. I argued that the rise in the incidence rate of this phenomenon developed from people’s recognition of a larger choice set, their desire for something new, and the opportunity to become their ideal selves.

			    <h3>Integrating Immigrant Children in the United States</h3>
			    <p>
				    May 2019 - I wrote a Geography research paper about the social and economic trajectories of immigrants of varying races and their potential to assimilate in the United States. I used these determinants to hypothesize the outcomes of second generation immigrants and their future descendants.

			    <h3>Global Fund Proposal</h3>
			    <p>
				    March 2020 - I wrote a Global Health research proposal that described the comprehensive program I developed to improve health outcomes for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine. I created a logic model and tied it to current government programs and social issues to demonstrate how my plan would increase accessibility of health services to key populations at risk.
